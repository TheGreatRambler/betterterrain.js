# betterterrain.js
The better terrain algorithm for javascript. Our perk? The terrain generates infinitely, yet it is just as detailed as terrain made with midpoint displacement!
Uses [@jwagner simplex-noise.js](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) which is itself based upon Stefan Gustavson's implementation. (Note: uses typed arrays)
